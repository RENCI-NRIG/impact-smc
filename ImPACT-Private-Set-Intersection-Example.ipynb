    "# Private Set Intersection using Secure Multiparty Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates using Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) to compare two secret lists and show which items occur in both lists. This makes it possible, for instance, for two researchers to compare lists of people and to see who occurs on both lists. The useful part is that this process is carried out in a way that keeps the non-matching names secret from the other party.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example, consider two researchers, Alice and Bob. Alice has a list of three people: Charlie, David, and Edna. Bob has a list of four people: Fred, David, Gretta, and Herbie. Using Private Set Intersection (PSI), Alice and Bob can learn that David is on both lists. Importantly, this is done without Bob learning about Charlie or Edna, and without Alice learning about Fred, Gretta, or Herbie.\n",

    "### Step 8: Look up the hashed value and see which names matched\n",
    "What just came back was a list of hashed values and some zeros. The zeros mean \"you had something here that didn't match\". In our example above, we have a 0, then 649415712, and then finally another zero. This means \"the first one didn't match, the second one did (and its hashed value is 649415712), and the third one didn't\". It's up to you to decide how to handle this - you could keep track of position numbers (in our example, the second line isn't a zero, so the second name in our list is the matching one) or we could look through the myPrivateSet variable and find the tuple that matches and take it apart. Either way is perfectly acceptable. Since this is a tutorial example, let's do it the easy way and match things up by position number."
