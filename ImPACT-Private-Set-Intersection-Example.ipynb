    "# Private Set Intersection using Secure Multiparty Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates using Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) to compare two secret lists and show which items occur in both lists. This makes it possible, for instance, for two researchers to compare lists of people and to see who occurs on both lists. The useful part is that this process is carried out in a way that keeps the non-matching names secret from the other party.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example, consider two researchers, Alice and Bob. Alice has a list of three people: Charlie, David, and Edna. Bob has a list of four people: Fred, David, Gretta, and Herbie. Using Private Set Intersection (PSI), Alice and Bob can learn that David is on both lists. Importantly, this is done without Bob learning about Charlie or Edna, and without Alice learning about Fred, Gretta, or Herbie.\n",
