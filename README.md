# impact-smc
SMC-related code, configuration files and docs
---

Much better documentation to follow, but briefly:

flaskr contains the web interface to the SMC utilities (in this case, SPDZ/2)
impact-bin conatins shell scripts for gluing things together, most useful ones being runSMC.sh and createTriples.sh
tripleadd is the pseudo-python code for adding the cohort counts. Trivial.
others, me, and parties list out how to find the other participants. Note that "parties" will go away very soon and will created on the fly, probably in /tmp.

Much better docs to follow. :-)
